## Component Libraries

In order to keep Alamofire focused specifically on core networking implementations, additional component libraries have been created by the [Alamofire Software Foundation](https://github.com/Alamofire/Foundation) to bring additional functionality to the Alamofire ecosystem.

- [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage) - An image library including image response serializers, `UIImage` and `UIImageView` extensions, custom image filters, an auto-purging in-memory cache and a priority-based image downloading system.
- [AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator) - Controls the visibility of the network activity indicator on iOS using Alamofire. It contains configurable delay timers to help mitigate flicker and can support `URLSession` instances not managed by Alamofire.

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+ / macOS 10.12+ / tvOS 10.0+ / watchOS 3.0+
- Xcode 10.2+
- Swift 5+

## Communication
- If you **need help with making network requests** using Alamofire, use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/alamofire) and tag `alamofire`.
- If you need to **find or understand an API**, check [our documentation](http://alamofire.github.io/Alamofire/) or [Apple's documentation for `URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system), on top of which Alamofire is built.
- If you need **help with an Alamofire feature**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire).
- If you'd like to **discuss Alamofire best practices**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire).
- If you'd like to **discuss a feature request**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire). 
- If you **found a bug**, open an issue here on GitHub and follow the guide. The more detail the better!
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a pull request.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.0.0-rc.3'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Alamofire/Alamofire" "5.0.0-rc.3"
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git", from: "5.0.0-rc.3")
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Alamofire into your project manually.

#### Embedded Framework

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory, and run the following command "if" your project is not initialized as a git repository:

  ```bash
  $ git init
  ```

- Add Alamofire as a git [submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command:

  ```bash
  $ git submodule add https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git
  ```

- Open the new `Alamofire` folder, and drag the `Alamofire.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.

    > It should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.

- Select the `Alamofire.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the "Embedded Binaries" section.
- You will see two different `Alamofire.xcodeproj` folders each with two different versions of the `Alamofire.framework` nested inside a `Products` folder.

    > It does not matter which `Products` folder you choose from, but it does matter whether you choose the top or bottom `Alamofire.framework`.

- Select the top `Alamofire.framework` for iOS and the bottom one for macOS.

    > You can verify which one you selected by inspecting the build log for your project. The build target for `Alamofire` will be listed as either `Alamofire iOS`, `Alamofire macOS`, `Alamofire tvOS` or `Alamofire watchOS`.

- And that's it!

  > The `Alamofire.framework` is automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.
